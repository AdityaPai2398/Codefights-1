# Description

Given the undirected graph, find the number of connected components in it.

Example

For

matrix = [[false, true, false], [true, false, false], [false, false, false]] the output should be dfsConnectedComponents(matrix) = 2.

Input/Output

[input] array.array.boolean matrix

The adjacency matrix of the undirected graph with no loops or multiple edges.

Constraints: 3 ≤ matrix.length ≤ 10, matrix[i].length = matrix.length.

[output] integer
