There are some apples. You are going to distribute them into gift boxes in such a way that boxes will contain equal number of apples. It's possible that some of the apples won't be used but there is a max limit on the number of apples that can be left out.

Assume that you have an infinite amount of gift boxes and that all the boxes have equal capacity.

Find the number of different apple distributions satisfying all of the above conditions.

Example

for apples = 7, boxCapacity = 4, maxResidue = 1 output should be 3

[input] integer apples

the number of apples, a positive integer [input] integer boxCapacity

the maximal number of apples that fit into each box, a non-negative integer [input] integer maxResidue

the maximal number of apples that you are allowed to leave out, a non-negative integer [output] integer

the number of different distributions
