# Description

We call a fraction a / b a nice fraction, if a and b are 5-digit positive integers and all ten digits are used exactly once in a and b combined (leading zeros are possible).

For a given integer n find the number in nice fractions, that are equal to n.

## Example

For `n = 22`, the output should be :

```javascript
niceFractions(n) = 1.
```

The only nice fraction is `51678 / 02349`.
