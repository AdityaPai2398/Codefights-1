# Description

Consider some segments with positive lengths on a straight line. You need to find the length of segments intersection.

Example

For left = [1, 2] and right = [4, 6], the output should be
segmentsIntersection(left, right) = 2.

[input] array.integer left

A non-empty array of integers representing left-end coordinates of segments.

[input] array.integer right

Array of integers of the same length as right representing right-end coordinates of segments, ith elements of both left and right correspond to a single segment.

[output] integer
