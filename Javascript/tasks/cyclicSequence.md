# Description
Given a sequence, check whether it is **cyclic increasing**.

## Example
For `sequence = [5, 9, 1, 2, 4]`, the output should be

```javascript
cyclicSequence(sequence) = true;
```

Increasing sequence can be started from number 1.

For `sequence = [1, 3, 2]`, the output should be

```javascript
cyclicSequence(sequence) = false.
```

- [input] array.integer sequence
- [output] boolean
- true if sequence is cyclic increasing, false otherwise.
