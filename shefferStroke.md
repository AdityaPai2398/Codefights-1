# Description
The `NAND` operation (also known as a `Sheffer` stroke) is an operation on two logical values. `It produces true, if - and only if - at least one of the operands is false.`

Given two `boolean` values a and b, return the value of A NAND B.

## Example
For `a = true and b = true`, the output should be `shefferStroke(a, b) = false`;

For `a = false and b = true`, the output should be `shefferStroke(a, b) = true`.
- [input] boolean a
- [input] boolean b
- [output] boolean
