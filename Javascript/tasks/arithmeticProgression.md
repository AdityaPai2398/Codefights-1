# Description
Given the first two elements of an arithmetic progression, find its nth element.

Example

For element1 = 3, element2 = 2 and n = 4, the output should be arithmeticProgression(element1, element2, n) = 0.

We can find that element3 = 1 and element4 = 0, so the answer is 0.

```
[input] integer element1
    The 1st element of the arithmetic progression.

[input] integer element2
    The 2nd element of the arithmetic progression.

[input] integer n
    A positive integer.
