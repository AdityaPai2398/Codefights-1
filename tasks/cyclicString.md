We call a string cyclic if it can be obtained by concatenating another string to itself many times (for example, s2 = "abcabcabcabc..." is cyclic since it can be obtained from s1 = "abc" in such a way).

Given some substring of a cyclic string s, find the length of the smallest possible string that can be concatenated to itself many times to obtain s.

Example

```
for "cabca" output should be 3

[input] string s1

non-empty string [output] integer
```
