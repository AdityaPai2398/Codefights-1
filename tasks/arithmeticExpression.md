# Description
Consider an arithmetic expression of the form A#B=C. Check whether it is possible to replace # with one of the four signs: +, -, * or / to obtain a correct expression.

# Example

```
For A = 2, B = 3 and C = 5, we can replace # with a + to obtain 2 + 3 = 5, thus

arithmeticExpression(2, 3, 5) = true

[input] integer A

[input] integer B

It is guaranteed that B â‰  0.
[input] integer C

[output] boolean

true if the desired replacement is possible, false otherwise
