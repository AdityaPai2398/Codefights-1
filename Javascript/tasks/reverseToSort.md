Determine if it is possible to sort an array by reversing one of its subarrays.

It's guaranteed that array is not sorted.

Example

for [-1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8] output should be true since we can reverse [5, 4, 3, 2] to make it sorted for [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6] output should be false [input] array.integer inputArray

[output] boolean

true if it is possible to sort an array (in strictly increasing order) by reversing one of its subarrays, false otherwise
