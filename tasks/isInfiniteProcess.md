# Description
Given integers a and b, determine whether the following pseudocode results in an infinite loop

while a is not equal to b do   increase a by 1   decrease b by 1 Example

For a = 2, b = 6, the output should be false. For a = 2, b = 3, the output should be true. [input] integer a

[input] integer b

[output] boolean

true if the pseudocode will never stop, false otherwise.
