## Description
Given integers l, r (l <= r), and step, consider the following sequence: l, l + step, l + 2 * step, .... Return an array containing all elements of that sequence that are less than r. Note that they should be stored in the same order as they occur in the sequence.

Example

For l = 1, r = 10, step = 3, the output should be [1, 4, 7].

    [input] integer l

    [input] integer r

    [input] integer step
        A positive integer.

    [output] array.integer
