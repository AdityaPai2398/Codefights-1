Caesar Box is a simple transposition cipher used in the Roman Empire, in which characters of the given message are broken into multiple lines that form a square when stacked up and then read the square column by column.

Given a message, encode it.

Example

For inputString = "a message", the square will look as follows:

a m

ess

age

Thus, the encoded message will be aea sgmse.

[input] string inputString

A string of length n2 for some integer n.

[output] string
