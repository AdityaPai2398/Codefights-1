# Description

Given two 3D vectors, find their dot product.

> A dot product is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two arrays.

## Example

For `v1 = [1, 1, 1]` and `v2 = [0, 1, -1]`, the output should be :

```javascript
dotProduct(v1, v2) = 0
```

The answer is `1 _0 + 1_ 1 + 1 * (-1) = 0`

- **[input]** array.integer v1

  Array of 3 integers representing the first vector.

- **[input]** array.integer v2

  Array of 3 integers representing the second vector.

- **[output]** integer
