Once Mary heard a famous song, and a line from it stuck in her head. That line was "Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?". Mary believes that a person is loved if and only if he/she is both young and beautiful, but this is quite a depressing thought, so she wants to put her belief to the test.

Knowing whether a person is young, beautiful and loved, find out if they contradict Mary's belief.

Example

```
For young = true, beautiful = true and loved = true the answer is false, since young and beautiful people are loved according to Mary's belief.
For young = true, beautiful = false and loved = true the answer is true, because Mary doesn't believe that not beautiful people can be loved.

[input] boolean young

[input] boolean beautiful

[input] boolean loved

[output] boolean

true if the person contradicts Mary's belief, false otherwise.
```
