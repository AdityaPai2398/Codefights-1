# Description

The positive integer n is given. How many solutions in positive integers does the following equation have:

```javascript
1 / n = 1 / a + 1 / b ?
```

Example

For n = 2, the output should be

```javascript
numberOfSolutions(n) = 3.
```

Note: For n = 2 solutions (a, b) = (3, 6) and (a, b) = (6, 3) are different.
