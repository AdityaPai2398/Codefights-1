# Description

Given an integer, rearrange its digits in such a way that the resulting value will have the maximal possible number of divisors. If there are several possible solutions, return the largest one.

Example

For n = 21, the output should be maxNumberOfDivisorsPermutation2(n) = 12.

12 has 6 divisors, while 21 has only 4 divisors.

For n = 111, the output should be maxNumberOfDivisorsPermutation2(n) = 111.

[input] integer n

A positive integer.

[output] integer

Note: if n contains zeroes, some of the possible rearrangements will include values with leading zeroes. In the context of this task, such values are admissible and should be returned without the leading zeroes.
