A person is moving along a straight line. Initially he is at point A. He goes to point B from A with speed equal to 1 meter per second. Immediately after reaching B he turns around and heads to A from B with the same speed. After reaching point A he turns around once again and heads to B. etc. We need an algorithm that identified the location of the person at any given moment in time.

It's guaranteed that A and B are two different points.

Example

toAndFroNaive(2, 4, 3) = 3

[input] integer a

coordinate of point A (in meters) [input] integer b

coordinate of point B (in meters) [input] integer t

positive integer representing time (in seconds) [output] integer

coordinate of the person t seconds after he left A
