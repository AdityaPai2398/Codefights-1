# Description

Define an integer's roundness as the number of trailing zeroes in it.

Given an integer n, check if it's possible to increase n's roundness by swapping some pair of its digits.

Example

For n = 902200100, the output should be increaseNumberRoundness(n) = true. For instance, one may swap the leftmost 0 with 1.

For n = 11000, the output should be increaseNumberRoundness(n) = false. Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (js) [input] integer n

A positive integer.

Constraints: 100 ≤ n ≤ 109.

[output] boolean

true if it's possible to increase n's roundness, false otherwise.
