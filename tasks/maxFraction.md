Given a list of fractions find the largest one.

Example

for numerators = [5, 2, 5], denominators = [6, 3, 4] output should be 2 since 5/4 is the largest fraction

    [input] array.integer numerators
        array of integers representing numerators of the fractions

    [input] array.integer denominators
        array of integers of the same length as numerators representing denominators where the i-th fraction equals to numerators[i]/denominators[i]

    [output] integer
        index of the largest fraction assuming that none of the fractions are equal
