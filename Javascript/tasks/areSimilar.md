Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements.

Given two arrays, check whether they are similar.

Example

for [1, 2, 3] and [1, 2, 3] the answer should be true
for [1, 2, 3] and [2, 1, 3] the answer should be true
for [1, 2, 3] and [3, 1, 2] the answer should be false
[input] array.integer A

array of integers
[input] array.integer B

array of integers of the same length as A
[output] boolean

true if A and B are similar, false otherwise
