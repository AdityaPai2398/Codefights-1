# Description
The look-and-say sequence is defined as follows:

Its first term is equal to 1. The nth term `(for n > 1)` is generated by reading the `(n-1)th term`. Thus,

the second term is 11, generated by reading the first term as "One 1" (There is one 1 in previous term); the third term is 21, generated by reading the second term as "Two 1"; the fourth term is 1211, generated by reading the third term as "One 2 One 1"; and so on.

Given some element of the look-and-say sequence, generate the next one.

## Example

```javascript
lookAndSaySequenceNextElement("1") = 11
lookAndSaySequenceNextElement("1211") = 111221
```

- [input] string element

  A string of digits representing some element of the look-and-say sequence.
