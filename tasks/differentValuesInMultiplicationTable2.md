Define a multiplication table of size n by m as follows: such table consists of n rows and m columns. Cell on the intersection of the **i<sup>th</sup>** row and the **j<sup>th</sup>** column `(i, j > 0)` contains the value of `i * j`

Given integers n and m, find the number of different values that are found in the table.

## Example
For `n = 3` and `m = 2`, the output should be

```javascript
differentValuesInMultiplicationTable(n, m) = 5
```
