# Description

Implement an algorithm that can output a substring of the given string given a starting point and a length.

Example

For inputString = "abcde", start = 2 and length = 3, the output should be mySubstringByLength(inputString, start, length) = "cde".

[input] string inputString [input] integer start

start is less than the length of string.

[input] integer length

The length of the substring. It's guaranteed that for a given start, length is such that the substring exists.

[output] string

substring of string starting from the start character of inputString with length equal to length.
