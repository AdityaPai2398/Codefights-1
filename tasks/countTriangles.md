Given a set of points, find the number of triangles with non-zero areas formed by some trio of the given points.

Example

```
for X = [0, 0, 1, 1], Y = [0, 1, 1, 0] output should be 4

[input] array.integer X

[input] array.integer Y

array of integers of the same length as X. These arrays represent a set of points (X[i], Y[i]). It's guaranteed that no two points coincide
[output] integer
```
