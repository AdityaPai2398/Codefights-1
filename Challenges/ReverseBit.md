# Description

Reverse Bit

I have an integer number, which I want to reverse by following steps:

Convert the number into binary string. Reverse binary string. Convert the reversed binary string back to integer. Can you help me write a function to do it ?

## Example

For `x = 234`, the output should be :

```javascript
ReverseBit(x) = 87

23410 = 111010102 => 010101112 = 8710.
```

### Input/Output

- **[input]** integer x

  A non-negative integer.

- **[output]** integer

  x reversed as described above.
