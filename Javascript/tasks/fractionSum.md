# Description

Implement a function that can sum two reduced fractions and produce a new one.

## Example

For `A = [3, 5]` and `B = [7, 5]`, the output should be

```javascript
fractionSum(A, B) = [2, 1].
```

`3 / 5 + 7 / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2 / 1`, so the answer is `[2, 1]`

[input] array.integer A

Array A of length 2 representing a reduced fraction `A[0] / A[1]`.

[input] array.integer B

Array B of length 2 representing a reduced fraction `B[0] / B[1]`.

[output] array.integer

Sum of A and B as a reduced fraction.
