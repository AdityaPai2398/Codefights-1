# Description

Determine whether a given fraction is proper.

    A fraction written as a/b is said to be a proper fraction if the absolute value of the fraction is strictly less than one. Otherwise it is called an improper fraction.

## Example

```javascript
properOrImproper([7, 2]) = "Improper"
```

-   [input] array.integer A

  array of two integers representing a fraction `A[0] / A[1]`

-   [output] string

    "Proper" if A contains a proper fraction, "Improper" otherwise
