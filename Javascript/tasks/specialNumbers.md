# Description
A number is considered special, if it remains the same (and continues being a valid number) when rotated by 180 degrees. For example, number 986 is special, but 11 or 9 aren't, because 1 ceases to be a digit after the rotation and 9 becomes 6 after the rotation.

Determine the number of special integers between l and r, inclusive.

## Example

For `l = 8` and `r = 8`, the output should be:

    specialNumbers(l, r) = 1

For `l = 66` and `r = 96`, the output should be:

    specialNumbers(l, r) = 3

[input] integer l

A positive integer.

[input] integer r

A positive integer, l â‰¤ r.

[output] integer
