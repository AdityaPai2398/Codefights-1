# Description

Given a sequence of integers, check whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by erasing no more than one element from it.

## Example

For `sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1]`, the output should be :

```javascript
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false;
```

For `sequence = [1, 3, 2]`, the output should be :

```javascript
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.
```

- **[input]** array.integer sequence
- **[output]** boolean true if it is possible, false otherwise.
