The Thue-Morse sequence is an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s obtained by starting with 0 and successively appending the Boolean complement of the sequence obtained thus far. This procedure yields 0 then 01, 0110, 01101001, 0110100110010110, and so on.

Find the n-th digit (1-based) of the Thue-Morse sequence.

Example

for n = 3 output will be 1 for n = 6 output will be 0 [input] integer n

positive integer [output] integer
