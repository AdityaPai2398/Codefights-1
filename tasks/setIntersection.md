# Description

Apply intersection to the given sets of integers.

Sets may contain duplicate elements.

Example

For A = [1, 1] and B = [1, 1, 1], the output should be
setIntersection(A, B) = [1, 1].

[input] array.integer A

Array representing set A (elements can be stored in any order).

[input] array.integer B

Array representing set B (elements can be stored in any order).

[output] array.integer

Array representing intersection of sets A and B (elements should be placed in non-decreasing order).
