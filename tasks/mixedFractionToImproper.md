# Description
We need to turn a mixed fraction into an improper reduced fraction

## Example

```javascript
mixedFractionToImproper([3, 1, 2]) = [7, 2] since 3 + 1/2 = 7/2
```

- [input] array.integer A

  an array of three integers representing the reduced mixed fraction in the form `A[0] + A[1] / A[2]`

- [output] array.integer

  array B of two positive integers representing a reduced improper fraction `B[0] / B[1]` equal to the input fraction
