### Description
Degree of a vertex of the graph is the number of edges that connect to it, where an edge that connects to the vertex at both ends (a loop) is counted twice.

Find degrees of all vertices in a given graph.

Example

for

[[false, true, true ],
 [true,  true, true ],
 [true,  true, false]]
output should be [2, 4, 2]

[input] array.array.boolean matrix

the incidence matrix of the undirected graph
[output] array.integer

an array of vertices degrees
