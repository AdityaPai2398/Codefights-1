Define a tower as a straight vertical segment with a bottom end on the X axis.

Consider some towers in pairwise distinct positions. A pair of towers is called visible if the segment that connects the top points of those towers doesn't cross any other tower (but may touch the tops of some towers).

Given positions on which the towers stand and heights of the towers, find the number of visible pairs of towers.

Example

for position = [3, 0, 6, 10], height = [2, 1, 4, 6] output should be 4

[input] array.integer position

[input] array.integer height

array of positive integers. i-th elements of both arrays correspond to the same tower [output] integer
