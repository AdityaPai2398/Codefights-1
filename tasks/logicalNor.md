# Description

The NOR operation (also known as a Peirce's arrow) is a logical operation on two logical values that produces true if and only if both operands are false.

Given two booleans a and b, return the value of a NOR b.

Example

For a = true and b = false, the output should be logicalNor(a, b) = false; For a = false and b = false, the output should be logicalNor(a, b) = true. [input] boolean a [input] boolean b [output] boolean
