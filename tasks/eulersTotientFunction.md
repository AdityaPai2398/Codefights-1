# Description

Given an integer n, find the value of phi(n), where phi is Euler's totient function.

Euler's totient or phi function is an arithmetic function that counts the positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.

Example

For n = 5, the output should be eulersTotientFunction(n) = 4.
