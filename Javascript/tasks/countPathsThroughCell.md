# Description

Consider a rectangular board consisting of `n x m cells`. You are standing in the cell with coordinates `(0, 0)`. You are going to reach the cell `(n - 1, m - 1)`. On each move you are allowed only to increase exactly one of your coordinates by 1.

Find the number of the paths which satisfy all of the above-mentioned conditions and traverse the cell `(x, y)`

## Example

for `n = 3, m = 3, x = 1, y = 1` output should be `4`

-   [input] integer n

    a positive integer

-   [input] integer m

    a positive integer

-   [input] integer x

    a positive integer less than n

-   [input] integer y

    a positive integer less than m

-   [output] integer
