You are playing an RPG. Currently your points total is equal to experience. To reach the next level your XP should be at least at threshold. If you kill the monster in front of you, you will gain more experience points in the amount of the reward.

Given values experience, threshold and reward, check if you reach the next level after killing the monster.

Example

For experience = 10, threshold = 15 and reward = 5, output should be true. For experience = 10, threshold = 15 and reward = 4, output should be false. [input] integer experience

[input] integer threshold

[input] integer reward

[output] boolean

true if you reach the next level, false otherwise.
