Remember that power challenge? It's back again, now with larger X.

Given number X, find numbers A and B such that X = AB and A is the smallest possible number.

### Examples

```
power2("27") = [3, 3].
power2("9904578032905937") = [17, 13].


[input] string X

0 < X < 10101
[output] array.string

Array of two integers: A and B, where 0 < B < 301.
