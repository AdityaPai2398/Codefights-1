# Description
Given an array A and an integer D, find two elements of the array such that their absolute difference is not greater than D but is as close to D as possible (there may be more than one such pair). Return the absolute difference between these two elements.

Example

For A = [3, 2, 1] and D = 2, the output should be differentValues(A, D) = 2.

```
[input] array.integer A
    Array of different integers with length greater than one.

[input] integer D
    A positive integer.

[output] integer
    The best possible absolute difference or -1 if no suitable pairs were found.
```
