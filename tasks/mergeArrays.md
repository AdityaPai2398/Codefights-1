Let's call an array sorted if its elements are arranged in a non-decreasing order. Given two sorted arrays, merge them.

Example

for A = [1, 2, 2, 4], B = [2, 3, 4] output should be [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]

```
[input] array.integer A

sorted array of integers [input] array.integer B

another sorted array of integers [output] array.integer

sorted array obtained by merging A and B
```
