You have N white balls, M blue balls and K black balls placed next to each other in one row. Find the number of unique permutations of all the balls with no two adjacent balls being both blue.

Example

Given N = 1, M = 1 and K = 1, since we have only 1 ball of each color, any permutation of the 3 would satisfy the condition, thus

ballPermutations(1, 1, 1) = 3! = 6 [input] integer N

A positive integer - the number of white balls. [input] integer M

A positive integer - the number of blue balls. [input] integer K

A positive integer - the number of black balls. [output] integer
