# Description

Several friends live along a straight street. They are friends, thus they enjoy visiting each other. However, they are lazy so none of them wants to visit a friend living more than maxDist meters away from them.

Given array houses representing coordinates of points where the friends live (in meters) and an integer maxDist, return an array representing the number of friends each person would be willing to visit.

## Example

For houses = `[1, 2, 4, 8, 10]` and `maxDist = 5`, the output should be `[2, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.

-   [input] array.integer houses

    Sorted non-empty array of distinct integers.

-   [input] integer maxDist

    A positive integer.

-   [output] array.integer
