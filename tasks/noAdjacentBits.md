# Description

Given a positive integer, check if it doesn't contain a pair of adjacent bits set to `1` in its binary representation.

## Example

`22` equals to `10110` in binary, which has a pair of `1` bits, so the answer is false.
`41` equals to `101001` in binary, which doesn't have adjacent `1` bits, so the answer is true.

-   [input] integer a

    A positive integer.

-   [output] boolean

    `true` if a doesn't contain a pair of adjacent bits set to `1`, `false` otherwise.
